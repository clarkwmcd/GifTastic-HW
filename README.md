Instructions

This app pulls GIPHYs from giphy.com using application protocol interfaces (API). Press any button for the animal you would like to see and 10 giphys will appear on the screen. Click on each giphy to start or stop the animation.

If there is an animal you would like to see giphys for that is not listed, you can add a button with a new animal by entering the animal name in the text box.

Enjoy!
